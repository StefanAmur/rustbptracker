## Synopsis

A website used for tracking known blueprints in the videogame Rust. It uses localstorage to remember which items users have selected so that they can close their browsers and come back having the same items selected.

## Motivation

Myself, being a player of the game Rust, wanted a way to keep tabs on which items I knew how to craft, and which items I had left to find out in the wasteland.
